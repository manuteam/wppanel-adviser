You need to create a **setup.json** in root directory.

Example of setup.json:

```javascript
{
"sections_exclude": [
    "edit.php",
    "upload.php"
    ],
"sections_include":[
        [
        "open_graph",
        "The Open Graph",
        "options-general.php?page=open-graph-wp"
        ]
    ], 
"manual_link": "https://domanin.com/manuals/"
}
```
